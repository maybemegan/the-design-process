# The design process

## Exercise: Using the phases that have been explained in this checkpoint, self-assess your strengths and weaknesses in each area of the Design Process. Rank your experience as being low, medium or high in each phase.

## Please be detailed in your response. If you feel like you have a lot of experience in a particular phase, share that background in your submission.

### Phases
1. Discovery
2. Strategy
3. Information architecture
4. Visual design
5. Development
6. Launch

* In working at an advertising agency, for three years it was my role to coordinate a similar process for my clients. I was the project manager who communicated the client's needs and setup all the necessary touchpoints throughout the project cycle, so I am definitely familiar with each phase, although I've never completed it as a designer or developer. 

**High**

I would say my strengths lie in the first two phases as these typically have the heaviest involvement for someone on the account side. In my time at the agency, I handled many different types of projects before I was assigned more of the digital opportunities I was so interested in. The Discovery and Strategy phases are set for any project type, whether it is a traditional campaign or digital, so I feel I have around 5 years of experience in executing these phases with the various teams involved. 

**Medium**

I've always been a strong writer and I feel content organization comes naturally to me. I proofread everything as I go, and coworkers definitely take notice fairly quickly. This skill paired with my expertise on the client's business and knowledge of the content available allowed me to work more closely with the UX Designer, Art Director and Copy Writer for some of my larger digital projects during the Information Architecture phase. I helped handle the _How_ more than the actual _Deliverables_ portion, but I sat in many meetings with clients where we boarded out site navigation and content structure and then painstakingly met with each team to collect content. 

**Low**

My overall experience with executing the Visual Design, Development and Launch phases I would rate in the low category. My role through these phases was to provide brand guidelines and sometimes participate in brainstorms, but I never handled the actual creative work. The thing about being on the account side is that you become a great judge of creative, especially in terms of your client, their teams and their department head. The stakes are often high, so as the last checkpoint before sharing the work I feel I do have a different perspective in my approach to this phase. 

Similar to the Visual Design phase, I have completed many reviews in test environments and I test code releases and defect fixes in my day-to-day work, but I have not done the coding myself. I've also given the green light to launch many times, but have not done it myself. I know how to test code on the different environments and most importantly, I know how to try and break it. :)
